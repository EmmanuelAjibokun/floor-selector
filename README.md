# Floor Selector

Floor Selector is a web application that allows users to select and visualize different floors of a building. It provides an interactive interface for navigating between floor plans, making it useful for property management, facility navigation, or architectural visualization.

## Tools & Libraries Used

- **React** for building the user interface
- **CSS Transition** for fluid transition animation during navigation
- **React Router** for navigation
- **Styled Components** for styling
- **Vite** for fast development and build tooling

## Known Limitations / Tradeoffs

- Currently supports only static floor data; dynamic data loading is not implemented.
- Mobile responsiveness is basic and may require further enhancements.
- Accessibility features are limited and may need improvement for full compliance.
